Therefore, the birth of freedom, we have endured all the pains and labour. And our hearts are heavy with the memory of this sorrow. Some of those pains continue not really now. Nevertheless, the past is over, and it is the future that becomes to us now. That future is not one of these or resting, but of incessant striving so that we might fulfill the pleasures we have through open-ticket and the one we shall take today. The service of India means the service of the millions of Sapa. It means the ending of coveting and ignorance and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity. The ambition of the greatest man of our generation has been to wipe every tear from every eye that may be beyond us, but so long as there are children suffering, so long our work will not be over. And so we have to labor and to work and work hard to give reality to our dreams. those dreams are for India, but they are also for the world for all the nations and peoples are to closely knit together today for any one of them to imagine that it can live a part. Peace has been said to be indivisible, so is freedom, so is prosperity now, and so also is disaster in this one world that can no longer be split into isolated fragments. To the people of India who represent today's we are, we make appeal to join us with faith and confidence in this great adventure. This is no time or pity and destructive criticism. No time for you will or blaming others. We have to build the noble mention of free India, where all the children need wealth. will.\",\n",

When we step out from the world to the new, when an agent, and when the throne of a nation, lungs suppressed, fine utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment, we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity. At the grown of history India started on her unending quest. And trackless centuries of feud with her spying and the grandeur of her successes and her failures. Who good and in what you know like she has never lost sight of that quest for God in the ideals which gave her strength. We end today a pariet of the infotainment and India discovers herself again. Their achievement we celebrate today is bodhisattva and opening of the opportunity to the greater triumphs and achievements that we just, how we brave enough and why we have enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the King's Law. We remain power, bring responsibility, that responsibility with the form this is simply a sovereign, a sovereign, a representing the sovereign people of India. Therefore, the birth of freedom, we have endured all the pains and labour. And our hearts are heavy with the memory of this sorrow. Some of those pains continue not really now. Nevertheless, the past is over, and it is the future that becomes to us now. That future is not one of these or resting, but of incessant striving so that we might fulfill the pleasures we have through open-ticket and the one we shall take today. The service of India means the service of the millions of Sapa. It means the ending of coveting and ignorance and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity. The ambition of the greatest man of our generation has been to wipe every tear from every eye that may be beyond us, but so long as there are children suffering, so long our work will not be over. And so we have to labor and to work and work hard to give reality to our dreams. those dreams are for India, but they are also for the world for all the nations and peoples are to closely knit together today for any one of them to imagine that it can live a part. Peace has been said to be indivisible, so is freedom, so is prosperity now, and so also is disaster in this one world that can no longer be split into isolated fragments. To the people of India who represent today's we are, we make appeal to join us with faith and confidence in this great adventure. This is no time or pity and destructive criticism. No time for you will or blaming others. We have to build the noble mention of free India, where all the children need wealth. will.\",\n",
